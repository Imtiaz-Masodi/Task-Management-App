Project Overview: Task Management App

The goal of this app is to allow users to create an account, log in, and manage their tasks. They should be able to:

    Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD operations).
    Organize tasks by categories (e.g., Work, Personal, etc.).
    Set deadlines and mark tasks as completed.
    Access a dashboard to see all tasks.
    Optionally, implement features like task prioritization, notifications, or time tracking.

Key Features

    User Registration and Login (Authentication)
        Users can register with an email and password.
        Users can log in using their credentials.
        Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or sessions for authentication.
        Optionally, implement "remember me" functionality.

    Task Management (CRUD Operations)
        Users can create new tasks, specify titles, descriptions, deadlines, and priorities.
        Tasks can be marked as completed or pending.
        Users can edit existing tasks.
        Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.

    Task Categories (Optional)
        Tasks can be organized into categories (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).
        Users can filter tasks based on categories.

    User-Specific Data
        Each user should only see their own tasks, not those of other users.
        Data is stored in a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

    Task Prioritization (Optional)
        Add a priority field to tasks (Low, Medium, High).
        Users can sort tasks based on priority or deadline.

    Due Dates and Deadlines
        Tasks can have a due date or deadline.
        The app can display overdue tasks or upcoming tasks based on the current date.

    Responsive UI (Frontend)
        While youâ€™re focusing on Express.js, having a simple front-end (perhaps with EJS, Pug, or even a frontend framework like React) will enhance your project.

Technologies and Libraries

    Backend:
        Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.
        MongoDB (with Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (with Sequelize) for storing user and task data.
        JWT for user authentication or Express-session for session-based authentication.
        Bcrypt.js for securely hashing passwords.
        CORS for handling cross-origin requests (if you're working with a separate frontend).
        Express Validator or Joi for validating user input.

    Frontend (optional, if you want to build a UI):
        EJS/Pug as a templating engine for rendering dynamic views.
        React.js or Vue.js if you decide to build a more sophisticated UI (could use Axios to interact with the backend).

    Deployment:
        Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify for deployment.
        MongoDB Atlas (if using MongoDB) or Heroku Postgres (if using PostgreSQL) for cloud database hosting.
